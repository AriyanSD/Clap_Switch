A simple Arduino Code to use a Microphone Module (ky-037) for Detecting a double clap and turn the Lamp on or Off. An IR Reciever Also used in this project to manage the Lamp and sensor, We can use our IR remote to Turn Off the sensor or light.
The Digital Pins of Arduino sends its signals in 5v and we need a 5v relay to work as our switch to toggle the AC power of lamp with a dc 5v signal.
